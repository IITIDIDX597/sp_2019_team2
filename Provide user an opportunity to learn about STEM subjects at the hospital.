As a pediatric patient,
I want to learn about STEM subjects while I am in the hospital,
So that I can take quizzes and keep up with my school work


Sub Hill 3: The patient finishes a module by exploring each part and viewing the
animated video and the short quiz post that would gauze what have
they learned.
