As a pediatric patient,
I want Rube-E to be accessible while I am in bed
So that I can even lie down and interact with it directly without asking anyone to help me get it

Sub Hill 6: The toy would be used by in-patient on their bedside and they can engage
with it alone without requiring anyone help.


Acceptance Criteria 
Given: I am a pediatric patient
When: it fits the table next to my bed
Then: I can lay down on my bed and still be able to reach it
