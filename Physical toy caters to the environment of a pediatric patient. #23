As a pediatric patient,
I want Rube-E to be accessible while I am in bed
So that I can even lie down and interact with it directly without asking anyone to help me get it

Sub Hill 6: The toy would be used by in-patient on their bedside and they can engage
with it alone without requiring anyone help.


Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN: I'm a patient sleeping by the bedside in the hospital
AND: Nobody is around to help or assist
WHEN: I want to lear and pass my time
THEN: I should still be able to interact with the physical Rube-E toy
