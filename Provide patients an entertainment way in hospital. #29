Provide patients an entertainment way in hospital. #29

As a patient,
I want the videos to be engaging and informative
So that I will have more knowledge when I finish the module

Sub hill 3: The patient finishes a module by exploring each part and viewing 
the animated video and the short quiz post that would gauze what have they learned.



"Given I'm a pediatric patient in hospital waiting for the treatment
When I watch videos and touch the screen
Then I can review other people's real-time comments and send my comments."
