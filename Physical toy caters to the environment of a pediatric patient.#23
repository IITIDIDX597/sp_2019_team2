Physical toy caters to the environment of a pediatric patient.#23

As a pediatric patient,
I want Rube-E to be accessible while I am in bed
So that I can even lie down and interact with it directly without asking anyone to help me get it

Sub Hill 6: The toy would be used by in-patient on their bedside and they can engage
with it alone without requiring anyone help.

"Given I'm a pediatric patient,
When I lie down on the bed and want to play the toy
Then I can get in touch with Rube-E because it is within the area where I can reach."
