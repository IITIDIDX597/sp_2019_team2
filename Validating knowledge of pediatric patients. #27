Validating knowledge of pediatric patients. #27

As a pediatric patient,
I want to finish a short quiz,
so that I can review if my understanding of what I have learned is correct.

Sub Hill 3: The patient finishes a module by exploring each part and viewing the
animated video and the short quiz post that would gauze what have
they learned.


Scenario: User watches videos and completes quizzes 

Acceptance criteria 2
Given I'm a pediatric patient
When I watch videos played by Robe-E about STEM subjects
Then it provides a corresponding quiz, which when completed, the system shows the correct answers
