As a pediatric patient,
I want to finish a short quiz,
so that I can review if my understanding of what I have learned is correct.

Sub Hill 3: The patient finishes a module by exploring each part and viewing the
animated video and the short quiz post that would gauze what have
they learned.


Acceptance Criteria:
Given:I am a pediatric patient at the hospital
When:I finish watching the whole module of a bodily system
Then:tested by my performance in the quiz
