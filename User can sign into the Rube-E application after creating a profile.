User can sign into the Rube-E application after creating a profile. 

As a Pediatric patient,
I want to sign into my Rube-E app and decide my expertise level
So that I can build my Rube-E toy with customized content and at my own pace.

Sub hill 1: The kids will engage with the application through signing-in with the smart 
device and decide their expertise level 


Scenario: User finishes a quiz to decide his/her expertise level in (what aspect?)

"Given I'm in a role of the signed-in pediatric patient 
When I enter the application for the first time
Then the system shows me a series of questions with word descriptions, pictures, videos, and options about (what aspect?)
When I select an option for the first question after reading the question and watching videos or pictures
Then the system shows the next question until the last one 
And the system shows a progress bar consistently
When I finish all the questions 
And I click the "Submit" button
Then the system submits my answers 
And the system shows the results of my answers 
And the system gives a recommendation about my expertise level" 

This is a long acceptance criteria
