Collecting robot parts to build customized Rube-E model #19

As a pediatric patient,
I want to be motivated throughout when I am collecting more robots parts over time
so that I can have a sense of accomplishment and be more confident to finalize my own customized Rube-E toy.

Sub Hill 5: Words of encouragement would follow to keep the user going forward for next steps.


Scenario: User collects robots parts with the instruction on the screen 
Given I'm a pediatric patient in the hospital
When I have finished assembling my own Rube-E toy
Then the system automatically saves the toy into my profile and display a firework animation with a "Congratulation!"
