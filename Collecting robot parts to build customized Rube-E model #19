Collecting robot parts to build customized Rube-E model #19

As a pediatric patient,
I want to be motivated throughout when I am collecting more robots parts over time
so that I can have a sense of accomplishment and be more confident to finalize my own customized Rube-E toy.

Sub Hill 5: Words of encouragement would follow to keep the user going forward for next steps.


Scenario: User collects robots parts with the instruction on the screen 
"Given I'm a pediatric patient in the hospital
When I start collecting robots parts
Then the system shows "You're great! Let's start to do it!"
And the system displays a video instruction on the screen
When I watch and close the video
And I finish assembling the first part of the robot
Then the system shows "You're so brilliant! Keep going!"
When I complete the whole task and finalize my own Rube-E toy
Then the system displays a firework animation and "Congratulation!"
And the system automatically saves the toy into my profile"
