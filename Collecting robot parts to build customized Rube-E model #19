As a pediatric patient,
I want to be motivated throughout when I am collecting more robots parts over time
so that I can have a sense of accomplishment and be more confident to finalize my own customized Rube-E toy.

Sub Hill 5: Words of encouragement would follow to keep the user going forward for
next steps.

Acceptance Criteria
Given: I am a pediatric patient at the hospital
When: the app shows motivating words like a good job, congratulations, you are just a step away from over time
Then: I am motivated to keep learning to get more Rube-E parts
