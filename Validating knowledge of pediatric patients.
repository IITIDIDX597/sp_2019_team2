Story: Validating knowledge of pediatric patients.

As a pediatric patient,
I want to finish a short quiz,
so that I can review if my understanding of what I have learned is correct.

Sub Hill 3: The patient finishes a module by exploring each part and viewing the
animated video and the short quiz post that would gauze what have
they learned.


Scenario: User watches videos and completes quizzes 

Given I'm in the role of a pediatric patient
When I watch the videos played by Robe-E robots about STEM subjects
Then the system provides some corresponding quizzes along with the videos 
When I complete the quizzes
Then the system shows Rube-E robots and correct answers"
